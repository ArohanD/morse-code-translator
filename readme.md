# Vocal Codes
Vocal codes is a project inspired by my uncle, who can no longer speak/move after a severe injury. His movement is currently limited to movement of his right thumb, and I'm hoping to give him a way to talk by using this app as an interface. I am hoping to test this with him, but I figured I'd make the project public in case anyone else can use it. 

The app allows users to touch a button in intervals to generate morse code, which is then translated to text. It also features predictive text based on commonly used English words and a dictionary.

If you have any suggestions, please contact me at arohandutt.com!

# Get started

```
npm install
npm run compile
npm start
```

# Coming Soon

I'm actively working on the following features:

- Desktop functionality
- Full WAI-ARIA compliance (mostly there minus testing)
- Add global state so settings actually stick
- Utilize a database to improve predictive text based on global popular phrases
