# Vocal Codes
Vocal codes is a project inspired by my uncle, who can no longer speak/move after a severe injury. His movement is currently limited to movement of his right thumb, and I'm hoping to give him a way to talk by using this app as an interface. I am hoping to test this with him, but I figured I'd make the project public in case anyone else can use it. 

The app allows users to touch a button in intervals to generate morse code, which is then translated to text that can be either read on screen on spoken by the device. It also features predictive text based on commonly used English words and a dictionary.

If you have any suggestions, please contact me at arohandutt.com!

# Get started

```
npm install
npm start

# Coming Soon
- Mobile port to React Native
- Desktop functionality
- Full WAI-ARIA compliance (mostly there minus testing)
- Utilize a database to improve predictive text based on global popular phrases
